## About
My build of a graphical environment under the fedora distribution, based on the hyprland tile manager.
Unfortunately, I'm still bad at building packages, so I'll just leave all the necessary files here for now.

## System requitements
The mishmash of packages for my environment has not been tested anywhere else yet and has only run on Fedora Linux 41.

## Dependencies

1. **![Bibata modern ice (cursor)](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor)**
2. **![Colloid icons (icons)](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-icon-theme)**
3. **![Colloid gtk theme (theme)](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme)**
4. **![Hyprland (tiling compositor)](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)**
